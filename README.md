# PolymorphismEmployee
* (Payroll System Modification) Modify the payroll system of Figs. 20.9–20.17 to include
* private data member birthDate in class Employee. Use class Date from Figs. 18.6–18.7 to represent
* an employee’s birthday. Assume that payroll is processed once per month. Create a vector of Employee
* references to store the various employee objects. In a loop, calculate the payroll for each Employee (polymorphically),
* and add a $100.00 bonus to the person’s payroll amount if the current
* month is the month in which the Employee’s birthday occurs.
